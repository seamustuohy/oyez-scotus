    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EGregory Fisher was arrested and charged with possession of cocaine in 1988. He filed a motion for discovery, asking that the white powdery substance he had had in his possession be made available as evidence at trial so that he could have it independently tested in an attempt to disprove the four tests conducted by police showing that it was cocaine. The state agreed to make the substance available at a future date.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe defendant was released on bond, but in July of 1989 he failed to appear in court. He remained a fugitive for 10 years, during which time the police destroyed the substance in keeping with the standard practice of destroying old evidence. When Fisher was captured and brought to trial again in 1999, he claimed that the state had violated his Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Rights by destroying evidence that could possibly have proved his innocence after he had filed a motion for discovery. The trial court denied his motion, holding that the police had acted in \u0022good faith\u0022 in accordance with Arizona v. Youngblood. Fisher was subsequently convicted. The Illinois Appellate Court overturned the conviction, however, holding that the case was different from Youngblood because Fisher had filed a discovery motion. The state Supreme Court declined to hear the case.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDid Illinois police (acting in good faith) violate Fisher\u0027s Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights by destroying evidence after he filed a motion for discovery?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that the simple fact that Fisher had filed a motion for discovery did not distinguish the case from Youngblood. The Court also rejected Fisher\u0027s contention that the substance was \u0022material exculpatory evidence,\u0022 which would have made the good faith\/bad faith distinction irrelevant (whenever the state destroys or refuses to disclose \u0022material exculpatory evidence\u0022 it violates Due Process, regardless of its intent). Instead, the Court held that the evidence was at the most \u0022potentially useful evidence\u0022 (as it was in Youngblood) because the police had already determined, in good faith, that the material was cocaine. Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in this case.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
