    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EPolice interviewed Michael Alvarado, 17, without his parents at a police station about his involvement in a crime. Police neither arrested nor Mirandized Alvarado. During the interview, Alvarado confessed involvement. Based, in part, on these statements, Alvarado was convicted of second-degree murder and attempted robbery. After failed appeals in the California courts, Alvarado unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court in California. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Recognizing the \u0022in custody\u0022 standard to be whether a reasonable person would feel free to end interrogation, the appeals court held that a juvenile is more likely to feel he is in custody. Because Alvarado was \u0022in custody,\u0022 the Fifth Amendment required that his rights under Miranda v. Arizona (1966) be read to him.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EWhen deciding whether a suspect is \u0022in custody\u0022 and therefore entitled to his Miranda warnings, must an officer consider the suspect\u0027s age and previous history with law enforcement?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. In a 5-to-4 decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court ruled that the purpose of the Court\u0027s Miranda decision was to provide an objective rule readily understandable by police officers: when interrogating a suspect who is \u0022in custody,\u0022 an officer must first read the suspect his Miranda rights. Determining whether a suspect is actually in custody has always been based on objective criterion like whether he had been brought to the police station by police or had come of his own accord. Requiring officers to consider individual characteristics of a suspect when determining whether he is \u0022in custody,\u0022 such as the suspect\u0027s age or previous history with law enforcement, would make the test a subjective one that would be more difficult for officers to understand and abide by. Justice Kennedy wrote that the Miranda decision \u0022states an objective rule designed to give clear guidance to the police, while consideration of a suspect\u0027s individual characteristics - including his age - could be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
