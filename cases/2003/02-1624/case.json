    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EMichael Newdow\u0027s daughter attended public school in the Elk Grove Unified School District in California. Elk Grove teachers began school days by leading students in a voluntary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, including the words \u0022under God\u0022 added by a 1954 Congressional act. Newdow sued in federal district court in California, arguing that making students listen - even if they choose not to participate - to the words \u0022under God\u0022 violates the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution\u0027s First Amendment.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe district court dismissed Newdow\u0027s complaint for lack of standing, because he and the mother of his daughter are divorced and he does not have custody. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Newdow did have standing \u0022to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter.\u0022 The Ninth Circuit ruled that Congress\u0027s 1954 act adding the words \u0022under God\u0022 to the Pledge and the school district policy requiring it be recited both violated the First Amendment\u0027s establishment clause.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDoes Michael Newdow have standing to challenge as unconstitutional a public school district policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance? Does a public school district policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words \u0022under God,\u0022 violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EIn an opinion authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Supreme Court found that Newdow did not have standing to bring suit because he did not have sufficient custody over his daughter. \u0022When hard questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law,\u0022 Justice Stevens wrote. Because it found that Newdow did not have standing, the Court failed to reach the constitutional question. Chief Justice Renquist and Justices Sandra Day O\u0027Connor and Clarence Thomas all wrote seperate concurrences, saying that requiring teachers to lead the Pledge is constitutional.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
