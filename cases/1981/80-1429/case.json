    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003ENicholas Romeo was a 33-year-old man with the mental capacity of an 18-month-old child. Following the death of his father, Romeo\u2019s mother was unable to adequately care for Romeo and had him involuntarily committed to Pennhurst State School and Hospital (\u201cPennhurst\u201d) on a permanent basis. During his time in the state facility, Romeo suffered injuries on numerous occasions and was physically restrained at times. Romeo\u2019s mother became concerned, and after objecting to Romeo\u2019s treatment several times, sued the facility on behalf of Romeo. Romeo\u2019s mother claimed that his treatment violated the protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment. Specifically, Romeo\u2019s mother claimed Romeo had the right to safe conditions of confinement, freedom from bodily restraints, and access to habilitation (training or treatment with the goal of eventual release).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt trial, the court instructed the jury that they could only find that Pennhurst violated Romeo\u2019s constitutional rights if the officials had been \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to Romeo\u2019s medical and psychological needs, and the jury found in favor of Pennhurst. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Court of Appeals held the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment was inapplicable, because it applies to individuals convicted of crimes, not the involuntarily committed. However, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Romeo had liberty interests in freedom from restraint, safe conditions, and minimally adequate habilitation, which could only be violated if three distinct standards were met. An infringement of the right to safe conditions can only be justified by \u201csubstantial necessity,\u201d the right to freedom from bodily restraints can only be infringed for \u201ccompelling necessity,\u201d and the access to habilitation must be \u201cacceptable in the light of present medical or other scientific knowledge.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003E(1) Does the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grant an involuntarily committed patient the right to safe confinement?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E(2) Does the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grant an involuntarily committed patient the right to freedom from bodily restraints?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E(3) Does the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grant an involuntarily committed patient the right to adequate habilitation?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EYes, yes, unanswered. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court. The Court held that the involuntarily committed do have liberty interests in safe confinement and freedom from bodily restraint under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, a historical right to adequate habilitation was less clear, made especially so by the facts of the case in question. Because no amount of habilitation would allow Romeo to live independently, the Court was unsure what would qualify as adequate habilitation. The Court held that Romeo\u2019s liberty interests required Pennhurst to provide adequate habilitation, but only as it related to Romeo\u2019s right to safe confinement and freedom from undue restraint. The Court declined to answer whether the Fourteenth Amendment includes a stand-alone right to adequate habilitation, or how to determine the level of habilitation required to protect other liberty interests under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court emphasized the need to balance the legitimate interests of both parties involved to determine whether liberty interests were being adequately protected. In the involuntary commitment arena, deference to qualified professionals is necessary because of their specialized knowledge and the specific circumstances and risks inherent in a mental hospital. Therefore, such professionals and institutions can only be held liable for infringements on liberty interests when the decision by a professional is a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a concurrence emphasizing that the majority opinion had correctly not ruled on whether a state can accept an individual for care and then refuse treatment or whether the right to habilitation required Pennhurst to offer adequate training to preserve Romeo\u2019s original basic self-care skills. He argued that the record was not adequately developed to address these two issues. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor joined in the concurrence. In his separate concurrence, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that the Fourteenth Amendment did not contained a separate right to habilitation. Any right to habilitation only arises from other liberty interests, not as a liberty interest in and of itself.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
