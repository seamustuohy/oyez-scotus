    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 1972, the United States Congress passed Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibited federally funded education programs from discriminating on the basis of gender and allowed the government to withhold federal funds to non-complying educational institutions. Government agencies tasked with supplying federal funding to educational institutions were authorized to create regulations to enforce Title IX. In 1975, one of these agencies, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (\u201cHEW\u201d) passed regulations that extended the prohibition on gender discrimination to school personnel.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEmployees of two Connecticut school districts, North Haven and Trumbull, accused the districts of practicing gender discrimination. HEW opened investigations into both districts and eventually warned both that they were in jeopardy of losing their federal funds. Both districts filed separate suits against HEW, claiming that the regulation went beyond the authority of Title IX, which does not explicitly cover gender-based employee discrimination. In both cases, the district court found for the school districts by holding that Title IX was intended to apply to students, not employees. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district courts and held that Congress had intended Title IX to apply to both students and employees.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EIs Title IX\u2019s prohibition on gender discrimination in schools intended to cover the employees of schools?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EYes. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that, while Title IX does not expressly include employees, Congress\u2019s choice of words, i.e. \u201cno person\u201d as opposed to \u201cstudent\u201d or \u201cbeneficiary\u201d, implies an intention to broadly cover individuals involved in educational institutions rather than only students. The legislative history of Title IX supports the inference that Congress intended Title IX to prohibit gender discrimination of employees. Additionally, Congress was given the opportunity to view HEW\u2019s regulations and pass a resolution of disapproval if the regulations were inconsistent with Title IX. While such a resolution concerning the employee discrimination regulation was introduced, it was not passed. Therefore, Congress appeared to intend Title IX to apply to employee discrimination, and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare\u2019s regulations were valid.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a dissent in which he argued that the language of Title IX, on its face, did not apply to employee discrimination. Legislative history can only override the language of a law if the legislative history is clear and unambiguous that Congress intended Title IX to apply to employee discrimination. In this case, the majority opinion relied primarily on the statements of one congressman when analyzing the legislative history, which is not sufficient to support the majority\u2019s conclusion. Therefore Justice Powell held that Title IX did not apply to employee discrimination. Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent,\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
