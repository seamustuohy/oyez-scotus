    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EFollowing his arrest for murder, Leeander Blake invoked his right to speak with a lawyer. Before Blake\u0027s attorney arrived, however, an officer and a detective approached Blake to give him a copy of the charges against him. The statement of the charges included \u0022DEATH\u0022 as a possible penalty, although Blake was 17 years old and therefore too young to face the death penalty. The officer said to Blake \u0022I bet you want to talk now, huh!\u0022 The detective then said \u0022No, he doesn\u0027t want to talk to us. He already asked for a lawyer. We cannot talk to him now.\u0022 A half hour later Blake decided to speak to the police without his lawyer, and he proceeded to make incriminating statements about the murder. At trial, Blake argued that the incriminating statements were the product of an illegal interrogation, and therefore inadmissible. (Under \u003Cem\u003EEdwards v. Arizona\u003C\/em\u003E, police must cease interrogating a suspect after he requests an attorney, unless the suspect waives his previous request.) A county circuit court agreed with Blake, and ruled the statement inadmissible. On appeal, Maryland argued that Blake\u0027s interaction with the officer and the detective did not constitute an interrogation, because the officer\u0027s statement was a mere rhetorical question, and in any case was quickly corrected by the detective. An intermediate state appeals court agreed and allowed the statement to be admitted as evidence. However, the Maryland Court of Appeals reversed that decision, holding that the detective\u0027s correction did not reduce the severity of the officer\u0027s inappropriate statement. Since the officer\u0027s statement was ruled an illegal interrogation in violation of Blake\u0027s Miranda rights, the incriminating statement could not be used as evidence at trial.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EWhen a police officer improperly communicates with a suspect after the suspect has invoked his right to an attorney, does \u003Cem\u003EEdwards v. Arizona\u003C\/em\u003E permit consideration of curative measures by the police (such as the detective\u0027s quick correction of the officer\u0027s improper statement) to conclude that a suspect later initiated communication with the police?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EUnanswered. Shortly after oral argument, the Court dismissed the case. The anonymous \u003Cem\u003EPer Curiam\u003C\/em\u003E opinion stated simply: \u0022The writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
