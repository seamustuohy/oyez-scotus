The ACA sought to address the fact that millions of Americans had no health insurance, yet actively participated in the health care market, consuming health care services for which they did not pay.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ACA contained a minimum coverage provision by amending the tax code and providing an individual mandate, stipulating that by 2014, non-exempt individuals who failed to purchase and maintain a minimum level of health insurance must pay a tax penalty. The ACA also contained an expansion of Medicaid, which states had to accept in order to receive Federal funds for Medicaid, and an employer mandate to obtain health coverage for employees.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShortly after Congress passed the ACA, Florida and 12 other states brought actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida seeking a declaration that the ACA was unconstitutional on several grounds. These states were subsequently joined by 13 additional states, the National Federation of Independent businesses, and individual plaintiffs Kaj Ahburg and Mary Brown.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe plaintiffs argued that: (1) the individual mandate exceeded Congress\u0027 enumerated powers under the Commerce Clause; (2) the Medicaid expansions were unconstitutionally coercive; and (3) the employer mandate impermissibly interfered with state sovereignty.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe District Court first addressed whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit. It determined that Brown had standing to challenge the minimum coverage provision because she did not have health insurance and had to make financial arrangements to ensure compliance with the provision, which would go into effect in 2014. The court further determined that Idaho and Utah had standing because each state had enacted a statute purporting to exempt their residents from the minimum coverage provision.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe court also concluded that the Anti-Injunction Act did not bar the suit.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe District Court then addressed the constitutional questions. It ruled that the individual mandate provision was not a valid exercise of Congress\u0027 commerce or taxing powers. The court held the entire act invalid because the mandate could not be severed from any other provision. The court dismissed the states\u0027 challenge to the employer mandates and granted judgment to the federal government on the Medicaid expansions, finding insufficient support for the contention that the spending legislation was unconstitutionally coercive.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed 2-to-1 the District Court\u0027s holdings as to the Medicaid expansions and the individual mandate. But it also reversed the District Court, holding that the individual mandate could be severed without invalidating the remainder of the ACA.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",

    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo; Yes, under the Taxing and Spending Clause; Unanswered; Yes. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., largely joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, authored the majority opinion. The Court reached the following conclusions:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe justices unanimously agreed that the Anti-Injunction Act did not bar the suit. Congress did not intend that the payment for non-compliance with the Individual Mandate be a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, concluded that the Individual Mandate penalty \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C\/em\u003E a tax for the purposes of the Constitution\u0027s Taxing and Spending Clause and is a valid exercise of Congressional authority. The payment is not so severe as to be coercive, is not limited to willful violations like fines for unlawful acts, and is collected by the Internal Revenue Service by normal means.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of a jointly written dissenting opinion, Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito disagreed, arguing that because Congress characterized the payment as a \u003Cem\u003Epenalty\u003C\/em\u003E, to instead characterize it as a tax would amount to rewriting the Act.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChief Justice Roberts, with Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, concluded that the Individual Mandate was not a valid exercise of Congress\u0027 power to regulate commerce. The Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate existing commercial activity, but not to compel individuals to participate in commerce. This would open a new realm of Congressional authority.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Ginsburg, as part of an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan disagreed with this conclusion, arguing that the Chief Justice\u0027s distinction between economic \u0022activity\u0022 and \u0022Inactivity\u0022 is ill-defined and unsupported by either the Court\u0027s precedents or the text of the Constitution. Furthermore, even if the distinction were permissible, individuals who fail to purchase insurance nonetheless frequently participate in the healthcare marketplace, substantially impacting healthcare commerce, and may therefore be regulated by Congress.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Thomas, in a separate dissent, added that the \u0022substantial effects test\u0022 has encouraged Congress to push the limits of its power.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe majority did not address the serverability question after concluding that the Individual Mandate was constitutional.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito argued that the Individual Mandate and Medicaid expansion are inserverable, and that the entirety of the ACA is therefore unconstitutional. The provisions of the Act, they argue, are \u0022closely interrelated,\u0022 with the two unconstitutional provisions serving as \u0022pillars.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChief Justice Roberts, with Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, concluded that the Medicaid expansion provisions was unconstitutionally coercive as written. Congress does not have authority under the Spending Clause to threaten the states with complete loss of Federal funding of Medicaid, if the states refuse to comply with the expansion.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustices Ginsburg and Sotomayor disagreed, arguing, \u0022Congress\u0027 authority to condition the use of federal funds is not confined to spending programs as first launched. The legislature may, and often does, amend the law.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, concluded that the remainder of the Medicaid expansion provision, without the unconstitutional threat to \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely\u003C\/em\u003E withdraw Medicaid funding, could stand as a valid exercise of Congress\u0027 power under the Spending Clause.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito argued that the Court does not have the power to remedy the unconstitutional expansion as written.
