    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EA group of federal agents entered Colonnade Catering\u2019s (Colonnade) New York premises to search for resealed liquor bottles, possession of which is a violation of federal tax law. After searching for some time, the agents asked Colonnade\u2019s president, Salvatore E. Rozzo, to unlock a locked liquor storeroom. Rozzo refused and asked the agents if they had a search warrant. The agents responded that they did not need one. When Rozzo continued to refuse to unlock the storeroom, the agents broke the lock, entered the storeroom, and seized 53 bottles of liquor and two funnels.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt trial, Colonnade moved to suppress the evidence discovered in the warrantless search and argued that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted the motion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decision and held that the Fourth Amendment does not forbid warrantless administrative inspections. Therefore, the statutes, which authorize federal agents to enter any building or place where objects subject to a liquor tax are kept \u201cso far as it may be necessary\u201d in order to examine them during the day or business hours, do not violate the Fourth Amendment. The appellate court also found that the statutory provisions were equivalent to a warrant given their clarity and narrow scope.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EAre warrantless administrative searches and seizures of liquor allowed under statute and, if so, reasonable under the Fourth Amendment?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion for the 5-3 majority. The Court argued that business owners have a constitutional right to go about their business without unreasonable official entries onto their property. However, emphasizing a long history of liquor industry regulation, the Court stated that Congress has broad powers to fashion standards for reasonable searches of licensee\u2019s businesses. The Court did not find the statute unconstitutional, but interpreted the statute\u2019s imposition of a $500 fine on licensed liquor dealers who refuse to permit federal agents to inspect their liquor to mean that the fine was the only remedy available to the government upon a licensee\u2019s refusal to grant entry.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the term \u201cso far as it may be necessary\u201d authorized the search and that the statutory penalty was enacted merely to encourage compliance by licensed liquor dealers. Because Congress could not have intended to allow licensed liquor to avoid confiscation of their liquor for a relatively small $500 fine, the fine does not mean that liquor dealers can opt out of the statutory inspection. Justice Hugo L. Black and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice Hugo L. Black wrote that the statutes do not expressly declare forcible search and seizure illegal and thus implicitly authorized the seizure in this case. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the separate dissent.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
