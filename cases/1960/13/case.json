    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 1943, Peter Meyer took out life insurance policies in his own name worth $50,000. He pledged his insurance policies to Huntington National Bank of Columbus, Ohio as collateral security for a loan. This gave the bank the right to satisfy its claim out of the \u0027net proceeds of the policy when it becomes a claim by death.\u0027 After Peter Meyer pledged the policies to the bank, the United States determined that he owed $6,159.09 plus interest in unpaid taxes. The United States filed notice of tax lien on July 11, 1955.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeter Meyer died on December 28, 1955, owing $26,844.66 to Huntington National Bank. Ethel Meyer, the petitioner and Peter Meyer\u0027s widow, was named executrix of his estate and received $441.21, representing the remainder of the full cash surrender from Peter Meyer\u0027s insurance policies after payment to the bank.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe United States brought suit against Ethel Meyer under 26 U.S.C.A. 6321 and 6322, arguing that it should be compensated for the full tax lien by marshalling the funds already paid to Huntington National Bank. At trial, Ethel Meyer argued that she owed nothing to the government because she was not personally liable for Peter Meyer\u0027s tax lien. She also argued that the tax lien did not and could not attach to the net proceeds of the cash surrender because those proceeds would be exempt under New York Insurance Law.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDistrict court Judge Edmund Palmieri held that the government was entitled to recover the full tax lien through the insurance policy\u0027s full cash surrender. The court relied on \u003Cem\u003EUnited States v. Behrens\u003C\/em\u003E, where the court ordered a defendant to pay both a bank lien and tax lien from the same cash surrender. Although most of Peter Meyer\u0027s cash surrender was pledged to the bank for the payment of loans, this did not preclude the government from collecting on its full tax lien first. The U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, affirmed in a \u003Cem\u003Eper curiam\u003C\/em\u003E ruling. The court agreed that Behrens controlled the case.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003ECan a federal tax lien attach to the net proceeds of life insurance policies paid to Peter Meyer\u0027s widow?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. Justice Thomas Clark, writing for the majority in a 6-3 decision, held that New York state law controlled the case; New York exempted the net proceeds of insurance policy cash surrenders from attaching to tax liens. There was not clear guidance in federal law on this matter, whereas New York law protected the cash surrender in question. As the priority of liens is then determined by \u0022first in time first in right,\u0022 the United States did not have a right to marshal the cash surrender to recover its tax lien because the bank\u0027s debt had priority.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Byron White, joined by Justices John Harlan and Potter Stewart, dissented. He argued that federal law should control the case to avoid inconsistent results in different states; once a tax lien has attached to a taxpayer\u0027s interests, federal law then determines the priority of liens. He also disputed the majority\u0027s interpretation of New York law, and did not find a clear, consistent policy of protecting the net proceeds of insurance policies\u0027 cash surrenders from creditors.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
