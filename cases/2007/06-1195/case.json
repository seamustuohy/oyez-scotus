    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 2002 Lakhdar Boumediene and five other Algerian natives were seized by Bosnian police when U.S. intelligence officers suspected their involvement in a plot to attack the U.S. embassy there. The U.S. government classified the men as enemy combatants in the war on terror and detained them at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, which is located on land that the U.S. leases from Cuba. Boumediene filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging violations of the Constitution\u0027s Due Process Clause, various statutes and treaties, the common law, and international law. The District Court judge granted the government\u0027s motion to have all of the claims dismissed on the ground that Boumediene, as an alien detained at an overseas military base, had no right to a habeas petition. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal but the Supreme Court reversed in \u003Cem\u003ERasul v. Bush\u003C\/em\u003E, which held that the habeas statute extends to non-citizen detainees at Guantanamo.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2006, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA). The Act eliminates federal courts\u0027 jurisdiction to hear habeas applications from detainees who have been designated (according to procedures established in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005) as enemy combatants. When the case was appealed to the D.C. Circuit for the second time, the detainees argued that the MCA did not apply to their petitions, and that if it did, it was unconstitutional under the Suspension Clause. The Suspension Clause reads: \u0022The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the government on both points. It cited language in the MCA applying the law to \u0022all cases, without exception\u0022 that pertain to aspects of detention. One of the purposes of the MCA, according to the Circuit Court, was to overrule the Supreme Court\u0027s opinion in \u003Cem\u003EHamdan v. Rumsfeld\u003C\/em\u003E, which had allowed petitions like Boumediene\u0027s to go forward. The D.C. Circuit held that the Suspension Clause only protects the writ of habeas corpus as it existed in 1789, and that the writ would not have been understood in 1789 to apply to an overseas military base leased from a foreign government. Constitutional rights do not apply to aliens outside of the United States, the court held, and the leased military base in Cuba does not qualify as inside the geographic borders of the U.S. In a rare reversal, the Supreme Court granted certiorari after initially denying review three months earlier.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShould the Military Commissions Act of 2006 be interpreted to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over habeas petitions filed by foreign citizens detained at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf so, is the Military Commissions Act of 2006 a violation of the Suspension Clause of the Constitution?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the detainees at Guantanamo Bay entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law and of the Geneva Conventions?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECan the detainees challenge the adequacy of judicial review provisions of the MCA before they have sought to invoke that review?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003C\/ol\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EA five-justice majority answered yes to each of these questions. The opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, stated that if the MCA is considered valid its legislative history requires that the detainees\u0027 cases be dismissed. However, the Court went on to state that because the procedures laid out in the Detainee Treatment Act are not adequate substitutes for the habeas writ, the MCA operates as an unconstitutional suspension of that writ. The detainees were not barred from seeking habeas or invoking the Suspension Clause merely because they had been designated as enemy combatants or held at Guantanamo Bay. The Court reversed the D.C. Circuit\u0027s ruling and found in favor of the detainees. Justice David H. Souter concurred in the judgment. Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia filed separate dissenting opinions.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
