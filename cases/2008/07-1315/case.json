    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EAlexandre Mirzayance was convicted of first-degree murder in a California state court. He was subsequently denied post-conviction relief by the trial court and the California Court of Appeals. Mr. Mirzayance then petitioned for federal habeas corpus relief in a California federal district court. He maintained that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel because at trial, his attorney advised him to abandon his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI). The federal district court denied Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s petition, but was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to determining whether \u0022there were tactical reasons for abandoning the defense.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the hearing, the Magistrate Judge found that Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s counsel had \u0022nothing to lose\u0022 by going forward with the NGI plea and thus found his performance ineffective. The federal district court accepted this finding and granted Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s petition for habeas corpus relief. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s attorney\u0027s advice to withdraw his NGI plea was unreasonable because there was \u0022reasonable probability\u0022 the jury would find Mr. Mirzayance insane. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Ninth Circuit\u0027s decision, and remanded the case for consideration in light of \u003Cem\u003ECarey v. Musladin\u003C\/em\u003E. On remand, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its decision stating that Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s attorney\u0027s failure to pursue the NGI defense constituted ineffective counsel because it \u0022secured no tactical advantage.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003E1) Did the Ninth Circuit exceed it authority by granting habeas corpus relief without considering whether state court adjudication of Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s claim was \u0022unreasonable\u0022 under 28 U.S.C. Section 2254(d)?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E2) May a federal appellate court substitute factual findings of the district court without determining whether the district court\u0027s findings were \u0022clearly erroneous?\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EYes and not answered. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit, holding that the California Court of Appeals\u0027 decision to deny Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s petition for habeas corpus relief was not \u0022an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u0022 With Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court concluded that the Ninth Circuit reached an erroneous result because it applied an improper standard of review when it found Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s counsel ineffective for abandoning the NGI plea because there was \u0022nothing to lose\u0022 in pursuing it. Rather, the Court stated that in order to find counsel ineffective, the defendant must show both \u0022deficient performance\u0022 and \u0022prejudice.\u0022 The Court reasoned that Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s counsel was not deficient when he abandoned an NGI plea that had \u0022almost no chance of success.\u0022 Therefore, the California Court of Appeals was not \u0022unreasonable\u0022 in denying Mr. Mirzayance\u0027s petition for habeas corpus relief.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
