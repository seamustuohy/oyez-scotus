The Federal court has exclusive jurisdiction if the suit is brought to enforce Exchange Act duties even if the suit is also brought to enforce State law duties. In particular, the words \u0022brought to enforce\u0022 focus on what the plaintiff itself wants the court to decide, not on what the court would necessarily have to decide, as 1331 has been read to require. By applying the 1331 test, the Third Circuit not only ignored Section 27\u0027s distinct language but also its distinct policies, which strongly disfavor State court adjudication of Exchange Act duties and thus are exactly the opposite of the policies favoring State court adjudication that underlie the Jackson Pollock canvas this Court has painted over Section 1331. Respondents, however, begin not with the necessity rule derived from 1331 but with a much more aggressive position that Section 27 only creates jurisdiction over causes of action created by the Exchange Act itself and thus categorically bars jurisdiction over State-based causes of action like those asserted here."

Our position would be that that is still best interpreted as a lawsuit brought to enforce a duty or a liability created by State law, because the -- the State has decided by reference to have the duty being don\u0027t violate the -- the -- the Federal standard that you would get the injunction for.

That too is contrary to the text of the statute because 1331 has been construed -- it also doesn\u0027t have the textual requirement -- as having this necessity component precisely because if you don\u0027t have a necessity component, then you\u0027re taking away from State courts cases that State courts are competent to adjudicate. We know that Congress had literally the opposite premise here, that they didn\u0027t want State courts adjudicating, as Respondents\u0027 counsel\u0027s conceded, a certain class of cases. What class of cases is that? The statute tells us the answer."
