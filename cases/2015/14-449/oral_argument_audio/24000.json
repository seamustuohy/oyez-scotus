These are precisely the sort of evidence that shows that however bad you think Jonathan is, Reginald is worse because Reginald is the one who created the person Jonathan is. It\u0027s in a sense making Reginald doubly culpable for these offenses; that, well, whatever you think Jonathan did -- and yes, as Justice Scalia read, there were some horrific things done -- well, Reginald should be punished for not only everything Reginald did, but also everything Jonathan did. So this is precisely the sort of evidence that basically transfers all of Jonathan\u0027s actions to Reginald."

In terms of saying that -- that the test should be whether there is a reasonable risk -- and I will explain the difference between reasonable and serious in a minute -- but whether there was a reasonable risk that there would be evidence introduced, material, prejudicial evidence introduced that would -- that would, in fact, not have been introduced in a severed penalty-phase proceeding. And to go back to Justice Kagan\u0027s question about the intuitive difference between these two things, they\u0027re between -- excuse me -- trials and -- and penalty-phase proceedings, the answer is that\u0027s because in a -- in a trial, the -- the relative culpability of the defendants makes a big difference with respect to who\u0027s a conspirator, who\u0027s not a conspirator, who\u0027s a principal, who\u0027s an aider and abettor. But when we turn to the penalty phase, the inquiry changes, as Mr. Liu indicated -- it changes from exactly what happened to who this person is and whether or not the jury wants to put this person to death."
