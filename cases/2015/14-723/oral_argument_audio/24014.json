And I think it\u0027s not. It may not be the better policy in your view, but it\u0027s certainly one that is consistent with the spirit of ERISA, and so the decision that needs to be made is: What is this line of cases that this Court has decided? What did they say? And I think repeatedly from Great-West to Sereboff, you reiterated in CIGNA that in nonfiduciary cases, a lien is not equitable relief unless it\u0027s against property in the defendant\u0027s possession."

And so the framework this Court developed was to distinguish between equitable relief on the one hand and things like damages that, clearly, Congress didn\u0027t mean to include in the relief that would be available.

And so when we go and look at this and we think about it in terms of burdens, if there is any reasonable position, as you look at this, that a rule that says you can essentially go after general assets, means that some meaningful number of fiduciaries will abuse that to assert rights they don\u0027t have or to delay, then I think you need to go with the clear line of historical authorities.
