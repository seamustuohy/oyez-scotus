The upshot of Petitioner\u0027s position is that any time there\u0027s an interstate-commerce jurisdictional element in any of the Federal provisions that are referred to, only a violation of the Federal statute, only a Federal criminal prosecution and conviction will count as an aggravated felony, because no State crime, no foreign crime is ever going to have interstate commerce as an element.

It would also really multiply the difficulty of the proceedings and make them much longer and harder. And I do think the language here is a little different here than the language that the Court was looking at in Nijhawan, where this $10,000 limitation was in the aggravated felony provision itself and it was worded in a particular way that the Court seized on. I -- I -- so I just don\u0027t think that analysis necessarily carries over here.
