Section 2284(b) lays out the procedure for calling a three-judge court when the circumstances identified in 2284 are satisfied. It -- it reads, quote, \u0022Upon the filing of a request for three judges, the judge to whom the request is presented shall, unless he determines that three judges are not required, immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges.\u0022 Now, although that language did not appear in the statute until the 1976 amendments, it was no more than a congressional recognition and codification of what was then by settled -- what was by then settled practice, that a complaint covered by 2284(a) would have, initially, to be referred to a single judge, that the litigants then would have to file a request for a three-judge district court, and in turn that the single judge would have to determine whether three judges were, in fact, required. Now, at the time that Congress enacted that long-standing practice in the 1976 amendments to the Act, this Court\u0027s precedents had made clear that one basis upon which three judges are, quote, \u0022not required\u0022 is when the claim is constitutionally insubstantial. Congress is presumed to have been aware of -- of this Court\u0027s precedents so holding, and in the absence of a contrary indication -- and here there is none -- to have intended that interpretation of the words \u0022not required\u0022 to be incorporated into the statute."

What\u0027s more, their reading of the statute also creates really difficult jurisdictional problems on appellate review.

And this Court affirmed that that was the correct procedure; that there was no reason to trouble the three-judge court if there was a statutory claim that could be resolved and rendered unnecessary to address the equal protection clause.

In Gonzalez, this Court read the phrase in 28 U.S. 1253, which is the direct appeal provision -- \u0022orders granting or denying an injunction,\u0022 this Court read to not include any denial of an injunction that would have been a sound basis for not convening a three-judge court in the first place.
