And I think, again, if you think of this as being a Surplus Land Act that simply opens the reservation up, a portion of it to settlement, then it makes perfect sense to say the Tribal members can take their allotments anywhere on the reservation. But if you think you\u0027ve really drawn a new boundary to the reservation, then I think it\u0027s more than passing strange that you can take allotments to the west of it, or you can take allotment and the new boarder is smack dab through the middle of it."
