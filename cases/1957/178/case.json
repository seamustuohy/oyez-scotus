    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EOn July 5, 1955, John Russell Crooker was arrested for the murder of his boss with whom he had been having an illicit relationship. For the next fourteen hours, Crooker was sporadically questioned and interrogated in his home and in the West Los Angeles Police Station; he repeatedly asked to meet with an attorney and was told that he could call only after the investigation was over. After fourteen hours of detainment and periodic interrogation, Crooker wrote a full confession to the murder. The next morning, Crooker was asked to orally repeat his confession, but he refused and again asked to speak with an attorney. Crooker was permitted to call his attorney at that point, and from then forward, he was represented by his counsel.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt trial, Crooker argued that his confession was obtained in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process because his confession was coerced by state authorities, and even if it was given voluntarily, he was denied the right to counsel. The issue of whether Crooker\u2019s confession was voluntary was presented to the jury, which resolved the question against Crooker and convicted him. The Supreme Court of California affirmed.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EIs a confession obtained during an interrogation in which the suspect asked for and was denied access to counsel obtained in violation of the suspect\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. Justice Tom C. Clark delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the coercion that might occur from a denial of a specific request for counsel can be negated by factors such as the defendant\u2019s age, intelligence, and education. In this case, Crooker had knowledge of his rights based on the fact that he was a law student and that he refused to answer some questions during interrogation. Additionally, Crooker was informed by the police officer that he didn\u2019t have to answer anything he didn\u2019t want to. Therefore, Crooker\u2019s confession was not coerced. The Court also held that, although Crooker\u2019s confession was made without counsel being present, his awareness of his rights meant that the absence of counsel did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the repeated denial of counsel to Crooker was a violation of his Due Process right. Justice Black also argued that the preservation of Due Process should also be applied to pre-trial investigation and therefore that the accused who wants counsel should have one at any time after the arrest. Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Black Hugo L. Black, and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the dissent.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
