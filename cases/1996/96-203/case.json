    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EWhile testifying before a federal grand jury, which was investigating the disposition of proceeds from the alleged drug trafficking of her boyfriend Earl James Fields, Joyce B. Johnson testified that she had received a box of cash that she had used to fund home improvements. Subsequently, Johnson was indicted for perjury under federal law, which proscribes \u0022knowingly mak[ing] any false material declaration\u0022 under oath before a grand jury. Johnson did not object when the District Court judge instructed the jury that materiality was a question for him to decide, and that he had determined that her statements were material. Afterwards, Johnson was convicted of perjury. However, before her appeal, the Supreme Court handed down a precedent that a jury, rather than a trial judge, must decide the materiality of a false statement. The Court of Appeals concluded the District Court judge had erred, but that any such error did not affect \u0022substantial rights\u0022 because its independent review of the record showed that there was overwhelming evidence of materiality and that no reasonable juror could conclude that Johnson\u0027s false statements about the money\u0027s source were not material to the grand jury\u0027s investigation.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",

    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice William J. Rehnquist, the Court held that the trial court\u0027s action in this case was not \u0022plain error\u0022 of the sort which an appellate court may notice under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b). The Court reasoned that there was no basis, on the record, for concluding that the materiality error had seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, in that the evidence supporting materiality was overwhelming. \u0022No \u0027miscarriage of justice\u0027 will result here if we do not notice the error and we decline to do so,\u0022 concluded Chief Justice Rehnquist.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
