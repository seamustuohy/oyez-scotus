    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003ECalifornia police officers saw Charles Acevedo enter an apartment known to contain several packages of marijuana and leave a short time later carrying a paper bag approximately the same size as one of the packages. When Acevedo put the bag in the trunk of his car and began to drive away, the officers stopped the car, searched the bag, and found marijuana. At his trial, Avecedo made a motion to suppress the marijuana as evidence, since the police had not had a search warrant. When the trial court denied his motion, Acevedo pleaded guilty and appealed the denial of the motion. The California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court, ruling that the marijuana should have been suppressed as evidence. The Supreme Court had ruled previously that officers can thoroughly search an automobile if they have probable cause to believe there is evidence somewhere in the vehicle ( \u003Cem\u003EU.S. v. Ross\u003C\/em\u003E ), and also that officers need a warrant to search a closed container ( \u003Cem\u003EU.S. v. Chadwick\u003C\/em\u003E ). The California Court of Appeal decided that the latter case was more relevant. Since the officers only had probable cause to believe the bag contained evidence - not the car generally - they could not open the bag without a search warrant. The California Supreme Court denied review, but the Supreme Court granted the State\u0027s petition.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EUnder the Fourth Amendment, may police conduct a warrantless search of a container within an automobile if they have probable cause to believe that the container holds evidence?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EYes. In a 6-3 decision authored by Justice Harry Blackmun, the Court reversed the Court of Appeal and ruled that the \u0022automobile exception\u0022 to the Fourth Amendment\u0027s general search-warrant requirement is broad enough to cover a situation where the police only have probable cause to believe there is evidence in a specific movable container within the car. The Court noted that the warrant requirement previously had depended on a \u0022curious line between the search of an automobile that coincidentally turns up a container and the search of a container that coincidentally turns up in an automobile.\u0022 In place of that uncertain distinction, the Court adopted a single rule: \u0022The police may search an automobile and the containers within it where they have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is contained.\u0022 Justices White, Stevens, and Marshall dissented.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
