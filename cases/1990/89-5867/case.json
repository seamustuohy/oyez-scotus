    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EShirley Irwin filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that he had been unlawfully fired by the federal Veterans Administration on the basis of his race and disability. In order to sue the federal government for unlawful discrimination, one must obtain a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC (which is a waiver of the government\u0027s sovereign immunity from private suits). The EEOC mailed right-to-sue letters to both Irwin and his attorney. His attorney was out of the country, however, so while the letter arrived at his office on March 23, the attorney did not receive it until April 10. Irwin receive his copy of the letter on April 7. Less than a month from when Irwin received the letter, but more than a month from when the letter arrived at his attorney\u0027s office, Irwin filed suit in federal District Court. The court dismissed the suit, however, because it was filed more than a month after the attorney\u0027s office received the letter. Under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(c), suits against the government must be filed within 30 days \u0022of receipt of notice of final action taken\u0022 by the EEOC. The court ruled that the 30-day window began when the attorney\u0027s office received the letter. On appeal, Irwin argued that the window should have started when he or his attorney - not just the attorney\u0027s office - actually received the letter. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument, however, upholding the District Court\u0027s decision.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDoes the 30-day window after \u0022receipt of notice of final action taken\u0022 by the EEOC within which a suit against the federal government must be filed begin when an attorney\u0027s office receives notification, or when the attorney or client himself receives notification?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EThe 30-day window begins as soon as either the attorney\u0027s office, the attorney, or the client receives notification - whichever comes first. In an opinion written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Supreme Court held that lower courts have consistently held that notice to an attorney\u0027s office qualifies as notice to the client. \u0022The practical effect of a contrary rule would be to encourage factual disputes about when actual notice was received, and thereby create uncertainty in an area of the law where certainty is much to be desired,\u0022 wrote Chief Justice Rehnquist.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
