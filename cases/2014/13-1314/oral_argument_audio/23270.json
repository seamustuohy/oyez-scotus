And I read White v. Weiser to say that if there is that kind of time, then you allow the State legislature to do it, because it\u0027s their primary task. Then the second question is, if there\u0027s not time and then there is a judicial plan, and let\u0027s say the first cycle of elections takes place under the judicial plan."

And this Court, in the Perry case, for example, rejected the idea that it\u0027s like you got one shot at this and then you\u0027re done for the whole decennial census. Now, there\u0027s at least one State, Colorado, that\u0027s basically said that if you get into that situation, then you got to live with the judicial plan until the next census; but then the legislature still kicks in and has the primary role. Now, I\u0027m inclined to think that what Colorado has done is inconsistent with the Elections Clause."
