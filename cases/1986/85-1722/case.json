    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EAhmad Uthman Shabazz and Sadr-Ud-Din Nafis Mateen were inmates in New Jersey\u2019s Leesburg State Prison. The prison classified inmates depending on the security risk each posed. Due to their classification, Shabazz and Mateen were assigned to a prison job outside of the main prison building and were not allowed to return to the main prison building during the workday. Because of these restrictions neither men, both of whom were practicing Muslims, were able to attend Juamu\u2019ah, a weekly religious service held on Fridays.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two men sued the prison and argued that the work policies infringed on their First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion. The federal district court found in favor of the prison and held that the prison policies plausibly advanced the goals of security, order, and rehabilitation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the lower court\u2019s ruling and held that the prison was required to show that there was no other reasonable method by which the inmate\u2019s religious rights could be accommodated without creating actual security problems.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EIf a prison policy infringes on inmates\u2019 free exercise of religion, must the prison show that there are no reasonable alternatives that would accomplish the same goal without creating an actual security issue?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that, while prisoners do not forfeit their constitutional rights after being convicted of a crime, being incarcerated does place necessary limitations on those rights. Because of the particular interests and dangers involved in prisons and the prison administration\u2019s everyday experience with the operation of a prison, courts should largely defer to prison administrators on questions of policy or regulation. Therefore, even when an inmate alleges that a prison policy infringes on his or her constitutional rights, the policy is valid as long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate penological objective, as the policy in this case was. The Court also held that a prison is not required to adopt any alternative policy that may have \u201cundesirable results,\u201d as determined by the prison.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissent in which he argued that a prison must demonstrate that the restrictions imposed on inmates were necessary to further an important governmental interest. He also argued that there should be a varying level of scrutiny depending on the nature of the right being asserted, rather than the general standard of deference in the majority opinion. Because the prison policy in the case in question acts as a complete ban that prevents some Muslim prisoners from attending Juamu\u2019ah, an obligatory and important religious ceremony, the prison should be required to show the policy was necessary and no less extreme measures could serve the same purpose. Justice Thurgood Marshall, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in the dissent,\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
