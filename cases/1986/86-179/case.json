    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003ETwo affiliate organizations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints operated Deseret Gymnasium, a non-profit facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. These affiliates were the Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (CPB) and the Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (COP). Arthur Frank Mayson worked for the Gymnasium for sixteen years as an engineer, but CPB and COP fired him when he failed to obtain a certificate authorizing him to attend the Church\u0027s religious temples. He filed a class-action lawsuit in District Court alleging that CPB and COP violated Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by dismissing him from nonreligious employment because he did not satisfy certain religious conditions. In response, CPB and COP claimed that Section 702 of the Act, as amended in 1972, exempts religious organizations from the Act\u0027s ban in Section 703 on religious discrimination. Mayson then claimed that Section 702 violated the First Amendment\u0027s Establishment Clause by allowing religious organizations to practice discriminatory hiring for nonreligious jobs. The District Court agreed that Mayson\u0027s job was nonreligious. It also held that Section 702 violated the Establishment Clause because it allowed religious adherents exclusive participation in nonreligious activities.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDoes Section 702 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 violate the Establishment Clause by allowing religious employers to choose employees for nonreligious jobs based on their religion?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for a unanimous court. The Establishment Clause forbids the government from using state mechanisms to advance a religion. Section 702 passed a three-part test the Court established in \u003Cem\u003ELemon v. Kurtzman\u003C\/em\u003E for determining whether a state action violates the Establishment Clause. To be valid, the state action must first promote a \u0022secular legislative purpose.\u0022 The Court found that Section 702 satisfied this criterion, since it ensured that the government would not determine for religious organizations what they could count as religious activities. Second, the state action can neither \u0022advance nor inhibit religion.\u0022 The Court held that for a violation of this standard to occur, the \u0022Government itself must have advanced religion through its own activities and influence.\u0022 In this case, the government allowed for a church to advance its religion but did not directly intervene. Third, the state action must not \u0022entangle\u0022 church and state. By allowing religious organizations to employ whom they pleased, they state became less entangled in religion.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
