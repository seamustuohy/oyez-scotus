    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EOn the night of June 16, 1962, a man later identified by a witness as Bob Granville Pointer entered a 7-11 Food Store and robbed the manager, Kenneth W. Phillips, of more than $300 The man then fled the store, and Phillips observed him talking to another man at a nearby intersection. A police dog led officers across the street from the 7-11 store to the front yard of a nearby residence, where Pointer was standing. A search of Pointer\u0027s person revealed eighty-one dollars in his billfold, and a later search revealed sixty-five dollars hidden in a discarded shoe.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe police arrested Pointer and Lloyd Earl Dillard and took them before a state judge for a preliminary hearing; the state charged them with robbing Phillips of $375 by assault, violence, or by putting in fear of life or bodily injury, in violation of Texas law. An assistant attorney general conducted the prosecution and examined witnesses, but neither of the defendants had a lawyer. Dillard tried to cross-examine Phillips, but Pointer did not.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPointer was indicted on the robbery charge. At trial, Pointer testified on his own behalf, denying his alleged role in the robbery and swearing he had never been in the 7-11 store. The state offered a transcript of Phillips\u0027 testimony as evidence because Phillips had since moved out of Texas and did not intend to return. The defense objected to the use of the transcript as a denial of Pointer\u0027s right to confront a witness. The trial judge overruled because Pointer was present at the preliminary hearing, and Pointer was convicted of murder. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction, rejecting Pointer\u0027s claim that the use of the transcript violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDid Texas violate Pointer\u0027s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by admitting evidence drawn from a preliminary hearing where Pointer was not represented by counsel?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EYes. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Hugo Black, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment\u0027s right of confrontation required Texas to allow Pointer an opportunity to confront Dillard through counsel. Justice Black declined to answer whether the Sixth Amendment required Texas to appoint counsel to represent Pointer at a preliminary hearing. Justice Black described the history of the Sixth Amendment in the Court, writing that the Fourteenth Amendment imposed the right to counsel on the states. He emphasized the importance of a defendant\u0027s right to confront witnesses against him and described it as a fundamental right.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice John Marshall Harlan II concurred in the result, rejecting the majority\u0027s assumption that Sixth Amendment rights were incorporated and applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Instead, he argued that a right of confrontation was implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Potter Stewart concurred in the result, also disagreeing that the states were limited by the Sixth Amendment. He characterized the right to cross-examine as one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Arthur Goldberg concurred. He emphasized that the Court largely agreed that certain basic rights were fundamental and not to be denied by either state or federal governments under the Constitution.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
