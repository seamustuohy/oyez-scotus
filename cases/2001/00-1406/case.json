    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EBeginning in 1972, Mario Echazabal worked for independent contractors at an oil refinery owned by Chevron U.S.A. Inc. When Echazabal applied for a job directly with Chevron, the company\u0027s physical examination revealed he had a liver condition, the cause identified as Hepatitis C. Chevron\u0027s doctors said that the condition would be exacerbated by continued exposure to toxins at the refinery. In response to Chevron\u0027s request that the refinery reassign Echazabal to a job without exposure to toxins or remove him, the contractor employing him laid him off. Echazabal filed suit, claiming that Chevron\u0027s action violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Under an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation that permits the defense that a worker\u0027s disability on the job would pose a direct threat to his health, Chevron defended its action. The District Court granted Chevron summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Appeals found that the regulation exceeded the scope of permissible rulemaking under the ADA.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDoes the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 permit the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u0027s regulation that allows the defense that a worker\u0027s disability on the job would pose a direct threat to his health?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that the ADA did not preclude the EEOC\u0027s regulation allowing the harm-to-self defense. The Court reasoned that deference applied to the regulation because it made sense of the statutory defense for qualification standards that are job-related and consistent with business necessity. The Court also found that the risk of violating the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) was enough to show that the regulation was permissible. \u0022Although there may be an open question whether an employer would actually be liable under OSHA for hiring an individual who knowingly consented to the particular dangers the job would pose to him, there is no denying that the employer would be asking for trouble: his decision to hire would put Congress\u0027s policy in the ADA, a disabled individual\u0027s right to operate on equal terms within the workplace, at loggerheads with the competing policy of OSHA, to ensure the safety of \u0027each and \u0027every worker,\u0022 wrote Justice Souter.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
