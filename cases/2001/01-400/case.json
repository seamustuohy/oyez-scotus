    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EGary Cone was tried in a Tennessee court for a 2-day crime spree that ended with the killing of an elderly couple. In response to the overwhelming evidence that he perpetrated the crimes, Cone\u0027s defense asserted that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found him guilty. During the sentencing hearing, Cone\u0027s counsel cross-examined prosecution witnesses, but called no witnesses. After the prosecutor closed, the defense counsel waived final argument. Ultimately, Cone was sentenced to death. The State Criminal Court denied Cone\u0027s petition for post-conviction relief, rejecting his contention that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the sentencing phase by failing to present mitigating evidence and waiving final argument. Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied Cone\u0027s federal habeas petition, ruling that he did not meet 28 USC section 2254(d)(1)\u0027s requirement that a state decision be \u0022contrary to\u0022 or involve \u0022an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.\u0022 In reversing, the Court of Appeals found that Cone suffered a Sixth Amendment violation for which prejudice should be presumed because his counsel, by not asking for mercy after the prosecutor\u0027s final argument, did not subject the State\u0027s death penalty call to meaningful adversarial testing.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",

    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. In an 8-1 opinion delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\u0027s decision neither was \u0022contrary to\u0022 nor involved \u0022an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law\u0022 under the provisions of 28 USC section 2254(d)(1). The Court noted that the defense counsel was defending a client who had committed a brutal and senseless crime against two elderly persons. Rather than closing, defense counsel prevented the lead prosecutor from arguing by waiving his own summation and relying on his opening plea for life. \u0022Neither option, it seems to us, so clearly outweighs the other that it was objectively unreasonable for the Tennessee Court of Appeals to deem counsel\u0027s choice to waive argument a tactical decision about which competent lawyers might disagree,\u0022 wrote Chief Justice Rehnquist. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
