    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003ESeveral states belonging to the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact (\u0022Compact\u0022) and the commission created by the compact (\u0022Commission\u0022) filed suit against North Carolina. The plaintiffs allege that North Carolina was designated as a host state for a waste management facility, accepted $80 million to build the facility, but then declined to fund, license, build, and operate it. The plaintiffs seek to recover the $80 million, a $10 million sanction, and attorneys\u0027 fees.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Supreme Court assigned the case to a Special Master who conducted proceedings and filed two reports. The Preliminary Report recommended denying North Carolina\u0027s motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds; denying plaintiffs\u0027 motion for summary judgment as to Count I which sought enforcement of sanctions against North Carolina; granting North Carolina\u0027s motion to dismiss Count I; and denying North Carolina\u0027s motion to dismiss Counts II-V. The Special Master\u0027s Second Report recommended denying Plaintiffs\u0027 motion for summary judgment and granting North Carolina\u0027s motion for summary judgment on Count II; and denying North Carolina\u0027s motion for summary judgment on Counts III-V. The parties then filed a total of nine exceptions to the Special Master\u0027s Reports.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003E1) Do sovereign immunity principles require the dismissal of the commission as a plaintiff in this original action brought jointly by the commission and four states against North Carolina?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E2) Does the compact authorize the commission to impose monetary sanctions against North Carolina in response to North Carolina\u0027s alleged breach of its obligations?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs\u0027 seven exceptions are overruled. With Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that the Compact does not authorize the Commission to impose monetary sanctions against North Carolina. Moreover, the Court reasoned that North Carolina did not breach its contractual obligation. The Court further held that North Carolina\u0027s two exceptions are overruled. The Court reasoned that the Special Master acted reasonably in denying North Carolina\u0027s motion for summary judgment with respect to Counts III-V.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, joined by Justice Sonia Sotamayor, concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. He stated that, despite some reservations, the majority was correct to reject the plaintiffs\u0027 final exception to the Special Master\u0027s Reports. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, concurred in part and dissented in part. He argued that \u003Cem\u003EArizona v. California\u003C\/em\u003E, relied on heavily by the majority, was a case \u0022built on sand,\u0022 and thus, not sufficient to support the majority\u0027s conclusions. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, concurred in part and dissented in part. He argued that North Carolina did breach the Compact when it suspended its efforts to build a waste disposal facility.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
