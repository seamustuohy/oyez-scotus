    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Christian Legal Society Chapter of the University of California, Hastings College of Law (CLS) filed suit against the university in a California federal district for violating its First Amendment rights. The Hastings College of Law failed to recognize the CLS as an official student organization because state law requires all registered student organizations to allow \u0022any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of their status or beliefs.\u0022 In contrast, CLS requires its members to attest in writing that \u0022I believe in: The Bible as the inspired word of God; The Deity of our Lord, Jesus Christ, God\u0027s son; The vicarious death of Jesus Christ for our sins; His bodily resurrection and His personal return; The presence and power of the Holy Spirit in the work of regeneration; [and] Jesus Christ, God\u0027s son, is Lord of my life.\u0022 The district court dismissed the case.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the school\u0027s conditions on recognizing student groups were viewpoint neutral and reasonable. Therefore, the school\u0027s conditions did not violate the CLS\u0027s First Amendment rights.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDid the Ninth Circuit err when its holding runs directly contrary to the Seventh Circuit\u0027s 2006 decision in \u003Cem\u003EChristian Legal Society v. Walker\u003C\/em\u003E?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. The Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit, holding that the college\u0027s all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the student organization forum; and, therefore, did not transgress First Amendment limitations. With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums, counseled the same result in this case. The Court further reasoned that, considering this constitutional inquiry occurs in the education context, Hasting\u0027s all-comers policy is reasonable and viewpoint neutral.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice John Paul Stevens, wrote separately, concurring. He agreed with the Court\u0027s holding and answered an argument raised by CLS that Hasting\u0027s Nondiscrimination Policy would be \u0022plainly unconstitutional\u0022 if addressed in this case. He disagreed with CLS noting that while the First Amendment may protect CLS\u0027 discriminatory practices off campus, it does not require a public university to validate or support such practices. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy also concurred. He noted that to be effective, a limited forum will exclude some speakers based on their affiliation, as occurred in this case. Justice Samuel A. Alito, joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, dissented. He critiqued the majority for expounding the principle: \u0022no freedom for expression that offends prevailing standards of political correctness in our country\u0027s institutions of higher learning.\u0022 He argued that the majority arms public institutions with a \u0022handy weapon\u0022 for suppressing the speech of unpopular groups.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
