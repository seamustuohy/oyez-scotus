Hillary, just January of this year, or in Patsy v. Florida Board several years back is the standard you measure it by, you have to say that the fact that Congress has been aware of the fact that contingency is a factor in setting fees, and Congress has refused to change it, even in the face of 13 circuits which have applied those multipliers, then that is an indication that Congress approves the multiplier, that nobody has been doing anything wrong in allowing the contingency multiplier to exist."
