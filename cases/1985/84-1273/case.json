    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EScott Ewing was enrolled in a medical program, and in the spring of 1981, he took and failed the NBME Part 1 (Exam), which is an exam his program required. After reviewing the status of several students in the program, the Promotion and Review Board (Board) voted unanimously to drop Ewing from the program. The Board took into account his recent failure as well as the totality of his academic record when making their decision. Ewing appealed the Board\u2019s decision four times and argued that, because every student before him who had failed the Exam had been allowed to retake it, he should be afforded the same opportunity. All of his appeals were unsuccessful.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn August of the following year, Ewing sued in federal district court and alleged a breach of contract as well as a violation of his right to due process. The district court sided with the University and Ewing appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that Ewing\u2019s right to enrollment qualified as a property right that deserved protection from arbitrary state interference under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003EDid the University arbitrarily interfere with Ewing\u2019s property, and therefore violate his right to Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment, by revoking his admission to the medical program?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grants citizens a substantive right to own property free from arbitrary state interference. The Court held that, even if Ewing had a property interest in his admission, the careful consideration that went into his dismissal made this interference with his property anything but arbitrary. The Court determined that Ewing\u2019s dismissal was reasonable based on all the available evidence.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. filed a concurring opinion in which he argued that the classification of Ewing\u2019s continued admission was not a constitutional property right deserving the protection of substantive due process, but rather a state issue requiring, at most, procedural due process protection.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
