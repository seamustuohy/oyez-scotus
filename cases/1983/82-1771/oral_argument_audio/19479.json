Now, if you don\u0027t feel there is a lot of Fourth Amendment law that needs to be developed in view of the fact that there is only one sentence in the Constitution, that may not bother you much, but it seems to me that it does kind of go against your idea that magistrates\u0027 findings are somehow reviewable in some other forum, you know not where, is, I guess, what your answer is."
