But what the Court of Appeals has done in this case, is to provide for an audit by the Court of Claims, an audit which will go into the question of how all of this money was used in the school year to go into the question really of an analysis of the tests, which were given by the teachers involved here and to determine whether or not these services because what would be involved here is the compensation for the teacher-prepared test, whether or not these tests, further the religious function of the schools and we would submit to the Court that, that type of a situation even on a one shot deal would create an excessive entanglement situation between the courts of New York State and the non public schools."
