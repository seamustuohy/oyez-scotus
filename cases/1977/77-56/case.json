    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EEdna Smith Primus was a practicing attorney who worked for a private law firm and was also affiliated with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a non-profit organization. She received no compensation for her work with ACLU. In her capacity as a lawyer at the private firm, Primus discovered women were being sterilized. Primus spoke to a group of the sterilized women to advise them of their legal rights and suggested the possibility of a lawsuit. One of these women, Mary Etta Williams, decided she wanted to sue her doctor over her sterilization. Primus then informed Williams through a letter of the ACLU\u2019s offer of free legal representation. Shortly after, Williams visited the doctor who sterilized her, signed a release of liability, and notified Primus she no longer intended to sue.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA few months later, the Secretary of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court of South Carolina (Board) filed a complaint that charged Primus with solicitation in violation of the Canons of Ethics, a code of professional conduct for lawyers. The Supreme Court of South Carolina, in accordance with the Board\u2019s panel recommendation, found Primus in violation of regulations regarding solicitation. Primus appealed and argued that the disciplinary action violated the First Amendment\u2019s protection of freedom of speech.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003ECan a state punish an attorney who advises someone of her legal rights and discloses that free legal assistance is available from a non-profit organization with which the attorney is affiliated?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 7-1 majority. The Court held that South Carolina\u2019s application of disciplinary action for the attorney\u2019s solicitation activity violated the First Amendment\u2019s protection of political expression and association as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case, Primus\u2019 actions were an expression of the political beliefs and civil liberty objectives of the ACLU, rather than actions personal financial gain. Therefore, reaching out to the sterilization victim was not a misrepresentation or invasion of privacy.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the states should decide which lawyers shall be admitted to or released from the Bar, and that the disciplinary action in this case does not violate the Constitution.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
