    "facts_of_the_case": "\u003Cp\u003EOver her nineteen-year career at Goodyear Tire, Lilly Ledbetter was consistently given low rankings in annual performance-and-salary reviews and low raises relative to other employees. Ledbetter sued Goodyear for gender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that the company had given her a low salary because of her gender. A jury found for Ledbetter and awarded her over $3.5 million, which the district judge later reduced to $360,000.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGoodyear appealed, citing a Title VII provision that requires discrimination complaints to made within 180 days of the employer\u0027s discriminatory conduct. The jury had examined Ledbetter\u0027s entire career for evidence of discrimination, but Goodyear argued that the jury should only have considered the one annual salary review that had occurred within the 180-day limitations period before Ledbetter\u0027s complaint.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the lower court, but without adopting Goodyear\u0027s position entirely. Instead the Circuit Court ruled that the jury could only examine Ledbetter\u0027s career for evidence of discrimination as far back as the last annual salary review before the start of the 180-day limitations period. The Circuit Court ruled that the fact that Ledbetter was getting a low salary during the 180 days did not justify the evaluation of Goodyear\u0027s decisions over Ledbetter\u0027s entire career. Instead, only those annual reviews that could have affected Ledbetter\u0027s payment during the 180 days could be evaluated. The Circuit Court found no evidence of discrimination in those reviews, so it reversed the District Court and dismissed Ledbetter\u0027s complaint.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "question": "\u003Cp\u003ECan a plaintiff bring a salary discrimination suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when the disparate pay is received during the 180-day statutory limitations period, but is the result of discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period?\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
    "conclusion": "\u003Cp\u003ENo. By a 5-4 vote the Court ruled that Ledbetter\u0027s claim was time-barred by Title VII\u0027s limitations period. The opinion by Justice Samuel Alito held that \u0022current effects alone cannot breathe life into prior, uncharged discrimination.\u0022 For a timely claim, Ledbetter would have needed to file within 180 days of a discriminatory salary decision; the Court did not consider it significant that paychecks she received during the 180 days prior to her claim were affected by the past discrimination. Discriminatory intent is a crucial element of a Title VII disparate-treatment claim, the Court held, but each instance of Goodyear\u0027s discriminatory intent fell outside the limitations period. The majority noted that the short time limit was enacted to ensure quick resolution of pay discrimination disputes, which can become more difficult to defend against as time passes. To adopt Ledbetter\u0027s argument would be to allow even \u0022discriminatory pay decision[s] made 20 years ago\u0022 to be the subject of Title VII claims. In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the majority\u0027s ruling out of tune with the realities of wage discrimination and \u0022a cramped interpretation of Title VII, incompatible with the statute\u0027s broad remedial purpose.\u0022 She suggested that \u0022the Legislature may act to correct this Court\u0027s parsimonious reading of Title VII.\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
