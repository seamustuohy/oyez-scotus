He had no experience in public office and charted an independent course once he was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Benjamin Harrison.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShiras\u0027s decade on the Court revealed an \u0022unadorned and cool style\u0022 and his interpretive approach relied heavily on precedent and conventional rules. The major issues confronting the Court included freedom of contract under the Fourteenth Amendment, the reach of national authority under the commerce power, and the constraints on individual liberty and property arising from legitimate enlargement of national power. Shiras was a participant in all these areas but he was not a leader in any one.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShiras came to the defense of individuals who challenged government power. But he did not articulate a compelling jurisprudence for others to follow. Shiras retired at seventy with little notice and died more than twenty years later with hardly a ripple of attention.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
