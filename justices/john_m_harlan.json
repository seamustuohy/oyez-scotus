Harlan studied law at Transylvania University (\u0022The Harvard of the West\u0022) and finished his legal education in his father\u0027s law office.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHarlan was a slaveholder and a member of the southern aristocracy, but he remained loyal to the Union over the Confederacy. Later, as head of the Kentucky delegation to the 1876 Republican national convention, Harlan helped the drive to nominate Ohio governor Rutherford B. Hayes. A year later, President Hayes nominated Harlan to the Supreme Court.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHarlan sat longer than most justices. In his long tenure, he earned the title of \u0022great dissenter.\u0022 Always within spitting distance of a spittoon, Harlan was perhaps the last of the tobacco-chewing justices.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
