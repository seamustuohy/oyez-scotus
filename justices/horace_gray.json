He had to cut short his travels when the family business experienced serious reversals. Gray studied at Harvard Law School, read law, and clerked at a law firm prior to his entering the bar.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the age of 36, Gray was appointed to the Massachusetts Supreme Court, the youngest appointee in its history. He quickly rose to the position of chief justice as older justices died or resigned.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring his 17 years on the Massachusetts court, Gray dissented only once and none of his decisions was overruled. He had the foresight while chief justice to hire a bright Harvard Law School student as his clerk, Louis D. Brandeis.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGray was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Chester A. Arthur; Grays\u0027 nomination was confirmed by the Senate the following day.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGray held to the view that law and politics were completely separate domains.
