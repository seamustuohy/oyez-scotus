From this political perch, Woods was elected to the state legislature and was soon chosen its Speaker.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWoods was a committed Democrat and resisted the growing Republican tide. At first, he opposed the Civil War but then acknowledged the necessity of a Northern victory. He joined the Union army and participated in the battles of Shiloh and Vicksburg.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the War, Woods settled in Alabama where he returned to law practice and took up cotton farming.
