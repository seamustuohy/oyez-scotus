    "biography": "\u003Cp\u003EHenry Billings Brown was born and raised in a small Massachusetts town. He led a privileged life, and was a good though undistinguished student. He avoided service in the Civil War by hiring a substitute, an accepted practice in his day.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBrown held several government positions at the federal and state levels. He was a well-regarded federal judge in Michigan when Howell Edmonds Jackson, a former senator and friend of President Harrison, urged Brown\u0027s move to the Supreme Court. Brown returned Jackson\u0027s favor by urging Harrison to \u0022bring up\u0022 Jackson three years later.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBrown authored in excess of 450 majority opinions during his years on the Court. He gave preference to private property claims and he defended free competition. But Brown also took a broad view of the state\u0027s police powers including governmental restrictions on laissez faire.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBrown will probably be forever marked by a single opinion he authored for a majority: Plessy v. Ferguson. Brown no doubt reflected the view of his day that whites were biologically separate from blacks and that whites were superior to blacks as a group.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
